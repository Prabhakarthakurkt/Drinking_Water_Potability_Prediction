# Drinking Water Potability Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the potability of drinking water using various water quality features. The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository.

## Contents

- `Drinking_Water_Potability_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model prediction.
- `Drinking_Water_Potability_Prediction.csv`: Dataset containing water quality features and potability labels.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `ph`: pH value of water.
- `Hardness`: Hardness of water.
- `Solids`: Total dissolved solids in water.
- `Chloramines`: Amount of chloramines in water.
- `Sulfate`: Amount of sulfate in water.
- `Conductivity`: Electrical conductivity of water.
- `Organic_carbon`: Amount of organic carbon in water.
- `Trihalomethanes`: Amount of trihalomethanes in water.
- `Turbidity`: Measure of water clarity.
- `Potability`: Indicates if water is safe to drink (0: Not Potable, 1: Potable).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prabhakarthakurkt/Drinking_Water_Potability_Prediction
   cd Drinking_Water_Potability_Prediction
